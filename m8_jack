In pavucontrol make sure that the M8 is off so pulseaudio doesn't grab it.
To see devices recognised by alsa run:
  aplay -l 
and look for:

card 1: M8 [M8], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 0/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

The corresponding alsa_in command to run is then:
  alsa_in -d hw:1

In qjackctl you can now connect teh alsa_in client to system playback
